# FiboTest
Optimizing recursive Fibonacci calculation using a dictionary cache

This is a simple demo of how to use a dictionary to cache the computed Fibonacci values in a recursive Fibonacci calculation algorithm and avoid redundant recursion for values in sequence that have already been computed.

The demo app displays two results for a number of steps in Fibonacci sequence to be performed:

The Fibonacci value is shown along with the number of times (in parenthesis) the recursive function was called.

There are two sets of results shown.

The first is without opptimization, the second is with the use of a dictionary to cache sequences that have alredy been computed.
